## 📱 Overview

The Livestream Calculator helps traders determine the optimal position size for futures contracts based on their current drawdown, stop loss, and trading platform rules. It provides clear recommendations for both mini and micro contracts, helping traders manage their risk effectively.

## 🆕 Recent Updates

The calculator now includes several new features to help traders optimize their position sizing:

- **Stock Position Calculator**: New dedicated tab for stock position sizing — enter entry price, stop loss price, and accepted loss to calculate the number of shares and position value.
- **Alternative Position Sizing**: The calculator now shows additional position sizing options that remain within 2% of your maximum allowed loss, giving you more flexibility.
- **Smart Contract Conversion**: When adding a micro contract would result in 10 micros, the calculator automatically suggests converting to an additional mini contract.
- **Risk Warning Indicators**: Visual warning icons appear when a position size exceeds the maximum allowed loss based on your platform's rules.
- **Improved Architecture**: The codebase has been refactored for better maintainability, with clear separation between calculation logic and UI components.
- **SEO Optimizations**: Comprehensive SEO implementation for better discoverability and multi-language support.

## ✨ Features

## 🚀 Usage

1. 💰 Enter your remaining drawdown amount
2. 🛑 Enter your stop loss in points
3. 🔄 Select your trading platform
4. 👁️ View the recommended position sizes for different contracts
5. For each contract, you'll see:
   - 🔢 Maximum number of contracts you can trade
   - 💸 The corresponding maximum potential loss
   - 🔄 Combination of mini and micro contracts when applicable

## ⚙️ How It Works

The calculator determines position sizing using this logic:

1. **Maximum Loss Calculation**:
   - For TopStep and APEX: `maxLoss = drawdown / 10`
   - For FTMO/WGF: `maxLoss = drawdown / 10`
   - For UFUNDED: `maxLoss = drawdown / 15`

2. **Position Size Calculation**:
   - `maxContracts = Math.floor(maxLoss / (stopLossPoints * contractTickValue))`

3. **Mini & Micro Optimization**:
   - First fills mini contracts (larger size)
   - If capital remains, adds micro contracts (smaller size)
   - Shows combined view when both are used
   - Automatically converts 10 micro contracts to 1 mini contract

4. **Alternative Position Sizing**:
   - Shows additional options within 2% of maximum allowed loss
   - Displays positions with one additional mini contract (if within limits)
   - Displays positions with one additional micro contract (if within limits)
   - Warning indicators appear for positions exceeding maximum allowed loss

5. **Visual Indicators**:
   - 🔵 Blue: Mini contracts
   - 🟣 Purple: Micro contracts
   - 🟢 Green: CFD lots
   - ⚠️ Yellow warning icon: Exceeds maximum allowed loss
   - Shows clear dollar value of risk taken

This ensures traders can maximize their position size while staying within risk management rules of their chosen platform, with additional flexibility for optimal position sizing.
